(Implement and manage virtual networking)  
Design a hybrid networking environment where on-premises networks connect securely to Azure resources using Azure's networking capabilities, ensuring secure data transition and effective resource access controls.

Programming required?: ❌ Minimal to none. This project is largely focused on networking configurations, but understanding scripting for automating certain tasks or deploying resources could be beneficial.

Azure Services Used:

Azure Virtual Networks
Azure VPN Gateway
Network Security Groups (NSGs)
Azure Bastion

Step 1: Set Up an Azure Virtual Network (VNet)
Go to Azure Portal:

Log in to your Azure Portal.
Navigate to: Create a resource > Networking > Virtual Network.
Create a Virtual Network:

Basics Tab:
Name: MyVirtualNetwork
Region: Choose your preferred region
Address Space: 10.0.0.0/16 (example)
Click Next: IP Addresses.
Configure Subnets:

Subnet Name: MySubnet
Subnet Address Range: 10.0.1.0/24 (example)
Click Next: Security.
Review and Create:

Review your settings.
Click Create.

Step 2: Set Up an Azure VPN Gateway
Create a VPN Gateway:

Navigate to: Create a resource > Networking > VPN Gateway.
Basics Tab:
Name: MyVPNGateway
Region: Same as your VNet
Gateway Type: VPN
VPN Type: Route-based
Virtual Network: Select MyVirtualNetwork
Public IP Address: Create new
Click Review + Create.
Configure VPN Gateway:

Wait for the gateway to be created, which might take up to 45 minutes.

Step 3: Connect On-Premises Network to Azure via VPN Gateway
Create a Local Network Gateway:

Navigate to: Create a resource > Networking > Local Network Gateway.
Basics Tab:
Name: MyLocalNetworkGateway
IP Address: Public IP of your on-premises VPN device
Address Space: Address range of your on-premises network
Click Create.
Create a Connection:

Navigate to your VPN Gateway.
Select Connections > Add.
Basics Tab:
Name: MyVPNConnection
Connection Type: Site-to-site (IPsec)
Virtual Network Gateway: Select your VPN Gateway
Local Network Gateway: Select your Local Network Gateway
Shared Key: Use a secure shared key
Click OK.

Step 4: Configure Network Security Groups (NSGs)
Create NSG:

Navigate to: Create a resource > Networking > Network Security Group.
Basics Tab:
Name: MyNSG
Region: Same as your VNet
Click Create.
Associate NSG with Subnet:

Navigate to your NSG.
Select Subnets > Associate.
Select your VNet and subnet.
Add Security Rules:

Add inbound and outbound security rules as needed.

Step 5: Set Up Azure Bastion
Create Azure Bastion:
Navigate to: Create a resource > Networking > Bastion.
Basics Tab:
Name: MyBastion
Region: Same as your VNet
Virtual Network: Select your VNet
Subnet Name: AzureBastionSubnet (with address range 10.0.2.0/27)
Click Review + Create.
